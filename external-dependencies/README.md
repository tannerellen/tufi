### Reblessed
This is a fork of blessed and intern has been forked again to make it compatible with bundlers and in this case specifically with making this project into an executable with Bunjs.
You can find the source of the library in this modified state here:
https://github.com/tannerellen/reblessed/tree/executable-safe

Copy the src and usr folders from the "executable-safe" branch.
